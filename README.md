JRPG is a kanji learning game styled after the classic SNES RPG games (like Final Fantasy 6, or Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past). The game tries to help you learn how to read and understand kanji in context, and in doing that it also helps you improve your Japanese vocabulary. You can also use it to refresh your kana.

There is also a playable demo of how JRPG would look like if it was styled after PlayStation 1 RPG games.
