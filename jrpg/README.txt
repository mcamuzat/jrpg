This file is not very up-to-date ^_^

== Fonts ==

The font file is simply included in the tarball now.

== Bugs and limitations ==

Probably the biggest limitation is always starting
from a very low level. Many people would rather
start fighting with tough kanji right away.

There are no quests after the dungeon yet.

== Thanks ==

jrpg was written by Tomasz Wegrzanowski, but I had a lot of
help from other people. I'd like to thank (in no particular order)
Carlos Fontes for Mac support, Maciej Katafiasz for the icon,
Ewa L. Cetnar for jrpg marketing campaign, Ben Davis, 
Helge Pettersen, Robert Krzyzanowski, Marc Camuzat, Nicholas Messenger,
Chris L. Ross, Kirsty Jenkins, Viktor Štujber, goddammf,
fuloatin, kirsty jenkins, Zemnovich Alex, russ groseth, Eric Dorland,
and many others for bug reports and helpful suggestions.

I'd also like to thank all people whose artwork jrpg uses.
They're listed in the Copyright section below.

== Copyright ==

I'm trying to make a completely open-source game, however I have to use
some materials from not completely free sources, or I couldn't get anywhere.

So I at least tried to separate material of different copyright status by file.

* The angband.png comes extra graphics for Angband, that were probably made by David Gervais.
  If I recall correctly, Angband was free for non-commercial purposes only,
  but I have no idea what's the status of the graphics.

* The charas were made by Tomasz Wegrzanowski in charas.ex (http://charas-project.net/),
  and as far as my contribution is concerned, they're placed in the public domain.
  However, I'm not sure what's the status of the pictures they were made of.
